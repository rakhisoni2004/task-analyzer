# Smart Task Analyzer  
A mini-application that scores, prioritizes, and visualizes tasks based on urgency, importance, effort, and dependencies.  
Built as part of the Software Development Intern Technical Assignment.

---

## 🚀 Features Overview

### ✓ Smart Priority Scoring Algorithm  
Tasks are scored using 4 weighted factors:
- **Urgency** (due dates, overdue boost)
- **Importance** (1–10 scale)
- **Effort** (quick-win favoring low-hours tasks)
- **Dependencies** (tasks that block others gain priority)

Includes 4 strategies:
- **Smart Balance** (default)
- **Fastest Wins**
- **High Impact**
- **Deadline Driven**

---

### ✓ Bonus Feature 1 — Dependency Graph Visualization  
- Tasks rendered as nodes  
- Directed edges show dependencies  
- **Cycle detection** with red-node highlight  
- Clean SVG layout with auto spacing and smart label wrapping  

---

### ✓ Bonus Feature 2 — Eisenhower Matrix  
Tasks plotted in 4 quadrants:
- Urgent & Important (Do First)
- Not Urgent but Important (Plan)
- Urgent but Not Important (Delegate)
- Not Urgent & Not Important (Eliminate)

Color-coded priority indicators included.

---

### ✓ Responsive Frontend (HTML + CSS + JS)
- Task input (manual + bulk JSON)
- Strategy selector dropdown  
- Priority score display with color coding  
- Graph view & Matrix view tabs  
- Clean dark-theme UI  
- Error handling + loading states  

---

### ✓ Backend (Python + Django)
- No database required (tasks come through request)
- API Endpoints:
  
#### **POST /api/tasks/analyze/**
Request:
```json
{
  "strategy": "smart_balance",
  "tasks": [
    {"id":"1","title":"Fix bug","due_date":"2025-11-30","estimated_hours":3,"importance":8,"dependencies":[]}
  ]
}
Response:

{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "title": "Fix bug",
      "score": 47.2,
      "explanation": {
        "urgency_text": "3 days left",
        "importance": 8,
        "effort_hours": 3,
        "blocks_count": 0
      }
    }
  ]
}

GET /api/tasks/suggest/

Returns top 3 tasks with explanations.

🧠 Algorithm Explanation (Summary)

Each task receives a composite score calculated as:

final_score =
    w1 * urgency_component +
    w2 * importance_component +
    w3 * effort_component +
    w4 * dependency_component

1) Urgency

Past-due tasks get heavy boost (120 + days overdue).

Due within 3 days → sharply increasing urgency.

Far future → lower urgency.

2) Importance

importance (1–10) × 9

3) Effort (Quick Wins)

Inverse of estimated hours:

effort = 30 / (1 + hours)

4) Dependencies (Blocking Power)

Each task that depends on this task adds weight.

Weights change based on selected strategy.
